# Resolutionary

Resolutionary is a system for scaling games made with [Game Editor](http://www.game-editor.com).

## Documentation

As of now, Resolutionary lacks a comprehensive documentation, but fear not - one is in the making.

[Resolutionary documentation](https://lclmetal.github.io/Resolutionary/code.html) (WIP, for now, this link takes straight to the reference page as rest of the site is not done yet)
