        <h2><a href="#limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
        
        <p>
            Resolutionary relies on Game Editor's <a href="http://game-editor.com/docs/script_reference.htm#draw_from" title="draw_from(); on Game Editor script reference"><code>draw_from();</code></a> function for resizing the actors, and thus, has the same limitations as the original function. Before you start implementing Resolutionary into your game, you should consider these limitations.

            <a href="illustration_transparency_bug.png" title="View full picture"><img src="illustration_transparency_bug.png" alt="Illustration showing how the canvases handle drawing transparent actors." /></a>
            <p>Drawing transparent actors on a canvas produces lacking results. A comparison between the original game view and how it looks when rendered in Resolutionary as two dynamic actors.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="p-subheader">Transparency is broken</h3>
        
        <p>
            The way canvases in Game Editor handle drawing transparent actors is pretty bad for Resolutionary - the colors of the actor get distorted and the area of the canvas itself becomes transparent.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To make matters worse, this also applies to any transparency in the animations of the actors. So, images that utilize an alpha layer to add transparency to individual pixels will be distorted. Using anti-aliased .png-images, for example, will result in visible artifacts on the outer edges of the animation.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="p-subheader">Resizing tile actors is not supported</h3>
        
        <p>
            If you've already built your levels using the Game Editor's built-in tiling feature, the only way to make the project fully compatible with Resolutionary is to redo the levels in some other form.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="p-subheader">Resizing text actors is not supported</h3>
        
        <p>
            You will have to use some other methods for resizing any text actors in your game. One possible solution could be to position all text actors relative to the edges of the screen, and then use different font sizes for different resolutions. Another way to solve the problem for static text actors could be to convert them to normal actors with pictures of the text.

        </p>
        
        <ol>

        <p>
            If you now enter Game Mode, you will see your game scaled to the resolution you selected. There may be some errors in the way your game is drawn, but don't worry, that's just because so far we've only set up the basic parts of Resolutionary, that are the same for every project. After these steps some further adjusting may be needed to fix positioning problems and to increase the performance of the scaling system.

        <p>
            In order to have your game function correctly after changing its resolution with Resolutionary, you'll have to make some changes in it.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Why:</em> The <em>Out of Vision</em> event of an actor is triggered when the actor leaves the area of the <code>view</code> actor. This makes the correct behavior of the <em>Out of Vision</em> events depend on the <code>view</code> actor being exactly the size of the visible game area, like it almost always is. But when changing the resolution of the game, the size of the <code>view</code> actor also changes. And as the main purpose of Resolutionary is to make it possible to change the resolution of a game, the consequence is that the <em>Out of Vision</em> events are not compatible with Resolutionary. Luckily, the <a href="../reference/actors/index.html#resActorDetector" title="resActorDetector on Resolutionary reference page"><code>resActorDetector</code></a> actor is sized exactly the same as the original size of the <code>view</code> actor (see <a href="#initial-configuration">Initial Configuration: 5</a>), so it can be used to simulate the <em>Out of Vision</em> functionality.

            <a href="illustration_misalignment.png" title="View full picture"><img src="illustration_misalignment.png" alt="Illustration showing the misalignment between the actors and the scaled drawings that represent them." /></a>
            <p>The actual game view and the Resolutionary view illustrated in relation to each other. The magenta blocks are the actual actors and the cyan blocks show where Resolutionary draws them. Two arbitrary actors have been labelled together with their Resolutionary counterparts.</p>

        <h3 id="convert-mouse-enter-leave" class="p-subheader">Convert <em>Mouse Enter</em> and <em>Mouse Leave</em> events to <em>Collision</em> and <em>Collision Finish</em> events with <code>resMouse</code></h3>
        
        <p>
            <em>Why:</em> Game Editor only registers <em>Mouse Enter</em> & <em>Mouse Leave</em> events for the actor with the highest z depth at the position of the mouse. The canvas actors that Resolutionary uses to draw the scaled game hide all the actors of the original game, disabling their <em>Mouse Enter</em> & <em>Mouse Leave</em> events completely. As a workaround the <a href="../reference/actors/index.html#resMouse" title="resMouse on Resolutionary reference page"><code>resMouse</code></a> actor is used to simulate the mouse position, so any <em>Collision</em> and <em>Collision Finish</em> events with it can be treated as alternatives for <em>Mouse Enter</em> and <em>Mouse Leave</em>.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="convert-mouse-down-up" class="p-subheader">Convert <em>Mouse Button Down</em> and <em>Mouse Button Up</em> events to <em>Activation Event</em> from <code>resMouseClickDetector</code></h3>
        
        <p>
            <em>Why:</em> Resolutionary doesn't scale the actual actors in the game, it just draws them on a canvas with the correct scale. With the resized actors being merely drawings on a canvas, they can't be clicked - the <em>Mouse Button Down</em> & <em>Mouse Button Up</em> events are not triggered for the actors by clicking their drawings. Also, the actual actors don't line up with their resized drawings correctly, so using <a href="http://game-editor.com/docs/script_reference.htm#eventdisable" title="EventDisable(); on Game Editor script reference"><code>EventDisable();</code></a> to disable mouse events for the Resolutionary actors for allowing clicking through them would still not solve the problem - see the illustration that demonstrates this misalignment.

            <strong>Important</strong>
            <br />The Debug Overlay is drawn using <a href="http://game-editor.com/docs/script_reference.htm#putpixel" title="putpixel(); on Game Editor script reference"><code>putpixel();</code></a> and is thus likely to decrease the overall performance of the system.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The Debug Overlay can be used to inspect what's going on inside Resolutionary at any moment of the game. It can display the following information:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The number of currently active dynamic and static actors</li>
            <li>The amount of memory allocated for the system (KiB)</li>
            <li>What actor(s) are being clicked by what mouse button, and which of them is the <em>"top actor"</em></li>
            <li>Listings* of the names of the currently active dynamic and static actors</li>
        </ul>

        <p><code>RES_DEBUG_PRINT_MAX_LENGTH</code> determines the size (number of characters) of the debug string. If the overlay says that the debug string has been overflown, you can solve the problem by increasing this value <em>(default: 2048)</em>.</p>
        
        <p><code>RES_DEBUG_FONT_DOT_SIZE</code> determines the size of an individual pixel on the Debug Overlay. Increasing the value makes the text larger <em>(default: 1)</em>.</p>
