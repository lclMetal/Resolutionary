                <li>Open your game in Game Editor.</li>
                <li>Select File -> Merge and navigate to the folder where you extracted the files from the .zip. Select "Resolutionary_template.ged" as the file to be merged into your game. It can be found inside the folder "Template".</li>

            <ol>
                <li>(Optional) Use <a href="code.html#resSetBackgroundColor" title="resSetBackgroundColor(); on Resolutionary reference page"><code>resSetBackgroundColor();</code></a> to set a background color for your game. If you don't specify a color, the color black will be used by default.</li>
                <li>(Optional) Use <a href="code.html#resSetBorderColor" title="resSetBorderColor(); on Resolutionary reference page"><code>resSetBorderColor();</code></a> to set a color for the borders that will appear if the game is scaled to a resolution with an aspect ratio differing from the original resolution. These borders are often called "black bars", but you can use any color you like. If you don't specify a color, the color black will be used by default.</li>
                <li>Use <a href="code.html#resStart" title="resStart(); on Resolutionary reference page"><code>resStart();</code></a> to start the Resolutionary system.</li>
                <li>Use <a href="code.html#resQuit" title="resQuit(); on Resolultionary reference page"><code>resQuit();</code></a> in a Key Down event of your choice (excluding Esc) to quit the Resolutionary system before exiting the Game Editor game mode. An exported game doesn't need this event, but for testing your game in Game Editor this is important for avoiding memory leaks. More information can be found on the <a href="code.html#resQuit">Resolutionary Reference page</a>.</li>
                <li>Resize the Filled Region actor called <code>resActorDetector</code> by dragging its corner so that it is the same size as the view actor in the original resolution of the game.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                The calls to <code>resSetBackgroundColor();</code>, <code>resSetBorderColor();</code> and <code>resStart();</code> can, for example, be placed in the Create Actor event of view, so that the system will start up at the same moment as the game itself.
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>// view -> Create Actor

resSetBackgroundColor(128, 128, 128); // Make the background gray
resSetBorderColor(0, 0, 0);           // Make the borders black
resStart(640, 480);                   // Start Resolutionary (the original resolution of the game is 640 x 480)
