				<p>Instructions on how to get Resolutionary, and how to merge it into your game.</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Download the most up-to-date version of Resolutionary as a .zip package via the link above.</li>
					<li>Use a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the files from the .zip.</li>
					<li>Open your game in Game Editor.</li>
					<li>Select File -> Merge and navigate to the folder where you extracted the files from the .zip. Select "Resolutionary_template.ged" as the file to be merged into your game. It can be found inside the folder "Template".</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			
			<div class="content-box" id ="initial-configuration-id">
				<h2>2. Initial configuration</h2>
				
				<p>These are the steps that you have to take after merging Resolutionary to your game for deploying the system.</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>(Optional) Use <a href="code.html#resSetBackgroundColor" title="resSetBackgroundColor(); on Resolutionary reference page"><code>resSetBackgroundColor();</code></a> to set a background color for your game. If you don't specify a color, the color black will be used by default.</li>
					<li>(Optional) Use <a href="code.html#resSetBorderColor" title="resSetBorderColor(); on Resolutionary reference page"><code>resSetBorderColor();</code></a> to set a color for the borders that will appear if the game is scaled to a resolution with an aspect ratio differing from the original resolution. These borders are often called "black bars", but you can use any color you like. If you don't specify a color, the color black will be used by default.</li>
					<li>Use <a href="code.html#resStart" title="resStart(); on Resolutionary reference page"><code>resStart();</code></a> to start the Resolutionary system.</li>
					<li>Use <a href="code.html#resQuit" title="resQuit(); on Resolultionary reference page"><code>resQuit();</code></a> in a Key Down event of your choice (excluding Esc) to quit the Resolutionary system before exiting the Game Editor game mode. An exported game doesn't need this event, but for testing your game in Game Editor this is important for avoiding memory leaks. More information can be found on the <a href="code.html#resQuit">Resolutionary Reference page</a>.</li>
					<li>Resize the Filled Region actor called <code>resActorDetector</code> by dragging its corner so that it is the same size as the view actor in the original resolution of the game.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>The calls to <code>resSetBackgroundColor();</code>, <code>resSetBorderColor();</code> and <code>resStart();</code> can, for example, be placed in the Create Actor event of view, so that the system will start up at the same moment as the game itself.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>// view -> Create Actor

resSetBackgroundColor(128, 128, 128); // Make the background gray
resSetBorderColor(0, 0, 0);           // Make the borders black
resStart(640, 480);                   // Start Resolutionary (the original resolution of the game is 640 x 480)
</code></pre>

				<h2>3. Changing the resolution</h2>
				
				<p>These are the steps that you have to take every time you want to change the resolution of your game.</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Set the resolution of your choice for the game from <em>Config -> Game Properties -> Game resolution</em>.</li>
					<li>Resize the actors <em>resDynamicLayerCanvas</em> and <em>resStaticLayerCanvas</em> so that they are the same size as the view actor.</li>

				<p>In order to have your game function correctly after changing its resolution with Resolutionary, you'll have to make some changes in it.</p>

					<li>Actions in <em>Mouse Enter</em> events have to be moved to <em>Collision</em> with <code>resMouse</code>.</li>
					<li>Actions in <em>Mouse Leave</em> events have to be moved to <em>Collision Finish</em> from <code>resMouse</code>.</li>
					<li>Actions in <em>Mouse Button Down</em> events have to be  moved to <em>Activation Event</em> from <code>resMouseClickDetector</code>.

						<p><strong>Notice:</strong><br />
						It is strongly recommended to take a backup of your game before merging Resolutionary into it. The merge process should be completely safe, but in case something goes wrong, it's good to have a backup.</p></li></ol></li>

				<h2>2. Initial configuration</h2>
					
					<h3>2.1 Set background color</h3>
						<p>Use <code>resSetBackgroundColor();</code> to set the background color for your game. If you don't specify a background color, the color black is used by default.</p>
						<p>A good place for calling <code>resSetBackgroundColor();</code> is in the Create Actor event of the view actor.</p>
					<h3>2.2 Set border color</h3>
						<p>Use <code>resSetBorderColor();</code> to set the color for the borders that will appear if the game is scaled to a resolution with an aspect ratio differing from the original resolution. These borders are often called "black bars", but you can use any color you like. If you don't specify a color, the color black is used by default.</p>
						<p>A good place for calling <code>resSetBorderColor();</code> is in the Create Actor event of the view actor.</p>
					<h3>2.3 Set system start event</h3>
						<p>Use <code>resStart();</code> to start the Resolutionary system.</p>
						<p>A good place for calling <code>resStart();</code> is in the Create Actor event of the view actor.</p>
					<h3>2.4 Set system quit event</h3>
						<p>Use <code>resQuit();</code> in a Key Down event to quit the Resolutionary system before exiting the Game Editor game mode. An exported game doesn't need this event, but for testing your game in Game Editor this is important for avoiding memory leaks. More information can be found on the <a href="code.html#resQuit">Resolutionary Reference page under <code>resQuit();</code></a>.</p>
						<p>For convenience, you can use the Key Up event for the same key for calling <code>ExitGame();</code> in order to return to Game Editor's edit view from game mode. This way, pressing the key will quit Resolutionary, and releasing it will bring you back to the edit view.</p>
