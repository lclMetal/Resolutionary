            Resolutionary is <a href="https://github.com/lclMetal/Resolutionary/blob/master/LICENSE" title="Resolutionary license">licensed under the MIT license</a>. The license is very permissive and allows* you to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Freely use Resolutionary commercially, non-commercially and privately</li>
            <li>Freely modify Resolutionary</li>
            <li>Freely distribute Resolutionary</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="important">
        <p>
            *the above permissions are granted by the following conditions:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You shall include the license file in your game files.</strong><br />
            Put it in the same .zip, for example, and maybe rename it to <em>RESOLUTIONARY-LICENSE.TXT</em> for clarifying that the license applies only to Resolutionary, not your game.</li>
            <li><strong>You shall credit me by mentioning Resolutionary and me as its creator.</strong><br />
            You could, for example, add something like this to your game's credits:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>This game uses Resolutionary by Lassi Lehtinen (aka lcl / lclMetal) for multi-resolution support. More info: lclmetal.github.io/Resolutionary/</em></li>

            <span class="answer-a">A:</span> Before making a bug report, please make sure that you've carefully followed the instructions provided in the <a href="../guide/">Usage guide</a> and that the problem you're having doesn't already have a working solution listed on the <a href="../guide/">Usage guide</a> or the <a href="../support/">Support</a> page.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you're certain that the bug you've encountered is something not covered on this site, make a bug report in either of the following two ways:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a new issue on <a href="https://github.com/lclMetal/Resolutionary/issues" title="Resolutionary issues">Resolutionary's GitHub</a> (requires a GitHub account)
                <p>Guidelines:</p>
                <ul>

        <h2><a href="#can-i-contribute">Q: Can I contribute to the project?</a></h2>
        
        <p><span class="answer-a">A:</span> Yes, you can. The preferable way is to use GitHub to make a pull request with your changes. However, if you're not familiar with using Git and GitHub and it all seems too complicated, you can still contribute by directly sharing your edited version of Resolutionary with me.</p>
        
        <h3 class="p-subheader">Contributing using GitHub</h3>
        
        <p>
            Create a GitHub account and fork the <a href="https://github.com/lclMetal/Resolutionary">Resolutionary repository</a>. If you're confident that you've managed to come up with a good addition or a bug fix, open a pull request from your fork. If the addition is good, it will then be merged to the main branch.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="p-subheader">Contributing outside of GitHub</h3>
        
        <p>If you're confident that you've managed to come up with a good addition or a bug fix, put your files in a .zip, upload it somewhere and send me a download link at lehtinen.lassi.c(at)gmail.com together with an explanation of what you've done and what parts of Resolutionary you've edited in the process. If the addition is good, it will be added to Resolutionary.</p>
        
        <div class="important">
            <h3>General guidelines on contributing</h3>
            
            <p>Here's some advice for contributing to the project. Notice that the better you explain what you've done and why, the easier it will be to evaluate your contribution. Making the evaluation process easier is likely to increase the chances of your contribution being added to Resolutionary.</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Adding new actors, animations, global variables or actor variables is not desirable, so try to avoid them if you can. Obviously, sometimes there is no other way than to use them - in such cases you're free to go ahead and do so.</li>
            
            <li>All changes to the Global Code page <em>Resolutionary</em> must also be saved to the file Resolutionary.c. This makes it much easier to track any changes made to the code.</li>
            
            <li>Document and explain what you do. Any changes in the events of the actors are not easily noticeable, so make sure to write down the changes and/or additions you've made. Explain what you've done and why. If you're contributing on GitHub, this info belongs to the Pull Request message. If you're contributing outside of GitHub, add this info either to the email or to a MESSAGE.txt file which you then include in the .zip.</li>
            
            <li>If you make changes to code in the events of the project actors or add new events, please make sure to note which codes you changed and what modifications or additions you made.</li>
            
            <li>Please follow the coding conventions of the project:
            
            <ul>
                <li>Maximum row length is 98 characters</li>
                <li>Each indent is 4 spaces wide</li>
                <li>Use <code>lowerCamelCase</code></li>
                <li>Use Allman style braces
                    <pre class="prettyprint">
<code>if (contributingToResolutionary)
{
    useAllmanStyleBraces = 1;
}</code></pre></li>
                <li>Comment functions using the following format:
                    <pre class="prettyprint">
<code>// Description of what the function does, can be divided on multiple rows,
// if required for staying within the maximum row length of 98 characters
// paramName - what should be given as the argument for the parameter
// paramName2 - what should be given as the argument for the second parameter
// returns: what the function returns (if the return type is void, this field is omitted)
//
// Example:
//
// This function returns the sum of two integer values given as arguments
// num1 - first integer value
// num2 - second integer value
// returns: the sum of the given integers values num1 and num2
int resSum(int num1, int num2)
{
    return num1 + num2;
}</code></pre></li>
                <li>Prefix all actor names, animation names, function names, global constant names, actor variable names and global variable names with <code>res</code> followed by a capital letter. Local variable names and struct member names need not be prefixed.</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ol>
